# SHEFFfolio

This personal portfolio expanded on solid work done by steren.fr with his express permission.

The original app was made in polymer 0.5, which I have ported over to Polymer 1.0 and expanded on functionality by adding additional pages and tabs, fix to tab navigation and other breaking changes between polymer 0.5 and 1.0.

The app follows a simple, clean & minimalist design philosophy to counterbalance a complex world.
